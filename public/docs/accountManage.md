## Intro

Admin is the one with the highest available permission level in our system.

The entrance for the following actions can be found in the `User` page under the `ADMIN` column of the sidebar.

## Actions

### Invite User

Two entrances - 

- The `Invite User` page under the `ACCOUNT` column of the sidebar.
- The `Invite User` button in the `ADMIN` - `User` page.

In the user invitation interface, you need to enter the correct `Email address` of the user to generate a unique ID for confirm purpose.

**However, the inviting email won't be sent automatically as the email system is disabled currently. In this case, you as the Admin need to send the confirmation code to the user manually so they can activate the account.**

### Delete User

Permanently remove the chosen user account from system by clicking the `Delete` button.

***This action is irrevocable.***

***This action CANNOT be performed on an admin account.***

### Edit Role

Click the `Edit` button to switch the chosen account role between ***user***, ***producer*** and ***admin***.

***This action CANNOT be performed on an admin account.***

### View User

Click the `View` button to check the account detail information.

### Search User

The `Search` box can be used to search accounts in a convenient way according to `username`.

You can also change the entries shown to adjust the display range.
